## Description

Assessment 1 tests your knowledge of in this course acquired matter.

This is a digital test that you take on your own computer.
Bring a charger, identification, and water (no food).
You are allowed to use the internet, but not to communicate with each other.
Using code found online is fine with citations and when you show you understand
it.

First, you download an unfinished project (zip) from Moodle.
Then, you finish several programming assignments where you add functionality
in the given project.
Finally, you hand in the finished project (zip) on Moodle.

How you finish steps is important.  Make sure your changes:

*   Do the requested things
*   Do not cause unhandled errors
*   Are valid and consistent
*   Are documented through code comments
